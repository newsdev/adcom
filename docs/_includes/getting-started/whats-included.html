  <h1 id="whats-included">What's included</h1>

  <p class="lead">Adcom is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.</p>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="jquery-required">
    <h4>jQuery required</h4>
    <p>Please note that <strong>all JavaScript plugins require jQuery</strong> to be included. The version requirements are defined in Adcom's <a href="{{ site.repo }}/blob/v{{ site.current_version }}/bower.json"><code>bower.json</code></a>.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="whats-included-precompiled">Precompiled Adcom</h2>
  <p>Downloading the Adcom zip file will give you just the compiled JavaScript and CSS necessary to use it. Minified versions of both are included as well.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-included-source">Adcom source code</h2>
  <p>The Adcom source code download includes the precompiled CSS and JavaScript assets, along with source CSS, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
adcom/
├── docs/
├── css/
├── js/
└── dist/
    ├── css/
    └── js/
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The top-level <code>css/</code> and <code>js/</code> files contain the source code for our CSS and JS. The <code>dist/</code> folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The <code>docs/</code> folder includes the source code for our documentation. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>
