<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="whats-included" class="page-header">What's included</h1>

  <p class="lead">Adcom is downloadable in two forms, within which you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified variations.</p>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="jquery-required">
    <h4>jQuery required</h4>
    <p>Please note that <strong>all JavaScript plugins require jQuery</strong> to be included. <a href="{{ site.repo }}/blob/v{{ site.current_version }}/bower.json">Consult our <code>bower.json</code></a> to see which versions of jQuery are supported.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="bootstrap-not-required">
    <h4>Bootstrap not required</h4>
    <p>While bootstrap enhances many of the features of Adcom, it is not required. The interactions defined by the JavaScript plugins were designed to work without any specific front end framework.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="whats-included-precompiled">Precompiled Adcom</h2>
  <p>Once downloaded, unzip the compressed folder to see the structure of (the compiled) Adcom. You'll see something like this:</p>
<!-- NOTE: This info is intentionally duplicated in the README.
Copy any changes made here over to the README too. -->
{% highlight bash %}
adcom/
├── css/
│   ├── adcom.css
│   ├── adcom.min.css
└── js/
    ├── adcom.js
    └── adcom.min.js
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>This is the most basic form of Adcom: precompiled files for quick drop-in usage in nearly any web project. We provide compiled CSS and JS (<code>adcom.*</code>), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (<code>adcom.min.*</code>). Fonts from Glyphicons are included, as is the optional Adcom theme.</p>

  <h2 id="whats-included-source">Adcom source code</h2>
  <p>The Adcom source code download includes the precompiled CSS and JavaScriptassets, along with source Less, JavaScript, and documentation. More specifically, it includes the following:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
adcom/
├── less/
├── js/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
└── docs/
    └── examples/
{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The <code>less/</code> and <code>js/</code> are the source code for our CSS and JS (respectively). The <code>dist/</code> folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The <code>docs/</code> folder includes the source code for our documentation, and <code>examples/</code> of Adcom usage. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.</p>
